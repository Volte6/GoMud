The <ansi fg="skill">scribe</ansi> skill gives the player the ability to write down things in the 
world. 
These will eventually decay into dust and scraps, but can be quite useful for 
a time.

You can train the <ansi fg="skill">scribe</ansi> skill at a <ansi fg="yellow">bard</ansi> training school.
With each level of training, the variety of things you can scribe increases.
