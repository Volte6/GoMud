title: The wasteland
description: The Endless Trashheap stretches to the horizon, a bizarre landscape of
  discarded wealth where mountains of forgotten relics rise like the ruins of a once-glorious
  civilization. Beneath a canopy of rust and jewel-toned refuse, the ground crunches
  with the detritus of countless treasures, creating dunes that shift with the Loot
  Goblin's ceaseless scavenging. A miasma of metal and decay fills the air, and hidden
  paths weave through valleys strewn with the spoils of a thousand conquests, lying
  in wait for those brave or foolhardy enough to seek the Goblin's hoarded riches.
  Here, in this paradoxical realm, the line between the precious and the worthless
  blurs, and treasure-seekers must tread lightly, lest they become yet another forgotten
  piece of the Goblin's endless collection.

- the mountain of trash shifts slightly.
- the trash heal trembles, threatening to collapse at any moment.
- the clinking of discarded coins resounds softly from a nearby pile.
- a sudden clatter erupts as a stack of ancient armor tumbles down.
- a glint of something shiny catches your eye before disappearing under a wave of
  rubbish.
- the ground gives a noticeable heave as if something below is stirring.
- the whisper of tattered silk flags flutters above, barely audible over the groans
  of shifting debris.
- a muffled giggle emanates from beneath a helmet two sizes too big for a goblin.
- you hear the faint jingle of keys somewhere beneath your feet.
- an old, rusted weapon briefly emerges from the trash, before being yanked back into
  the depths.
- a sudden silence falls over the trashheap, as if the very goblins themselves are
  holding their breath.
- the treasure beneath your feet seems to pulsate, as if the Trashheap itself has
  a heartbeat.
- a pungent smell wafts up as a new vent of steam bursts from the refuse.
- you catch a glimpse of a goblin darting behind a mound of broken crowns and scepters.
- the sound of something valuable breaking echoes through the trash valleys.
- the heap groans ominously, and for a moment the glint of a precious gemstone is
  visible.
- a sudden rush of wind carries away sheets of ancient parchment from atop the trash
  dunes.
- you hear the sound of liquid spilling and glass shattering somewhere in the distance.
- a soft, sorrowful tune plays from a damaged music box before being crushed underfoot.
- the treasure-laden ground seems to inhale deeply, and then a quiet pop as a bauble
  bursts from the pressure.
