<ansi fg="black-bold">.:</ansi> <ansi fg="magenta">Help for </ansi><ansi fg="command">damage</ansi>

The <ansi fg="command">damage</ansi> stat of weapons (and unarmed combat) represents combat attacks.

Damage is often reprsented as a dice roll. For example: <ansi fg="red">2d6+1</ansi>

In the example <ansi fg="red">2d6+1</ansi>, to calculate damage, you would roll <ansi fg="red">2</ansi> dice, each having 
<ansi fg="red">6</ansi> sides, and then add <ansi fg="red">1</ansi>  to the result. This is your final damage.

The possible damage range for <ansi fg="red">2d6+1</ansi> is <ansi fg="red">3</ansi>-<ansi fg="red">13</ansi>. As you can see, the minimum damage
scales up with the first number (Number of dice), whereas the maximum damage 
scales up with the second number (Number of sides)

Sometimes a weapon may automatically receive extra attacks. This is shown by 
a <ansi fg="red">#@</ansi> prefix to the damage. For example: <ansi fg="red">5@2d6+1</ansi> would attack <ansi fg="red">5 times</ansi> with <ansi fg="red">2d6+1</ansi>.
