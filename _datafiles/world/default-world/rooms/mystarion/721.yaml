title: Main road west
description: You are on the main western road, which leads out of Mysterion and down
  the mountain range. The air here is thick with the scent of exotic spices and freshly
  brewed potions, and the sounds of laughter and lively conversation mingle with the
  distant echoes of magical incantations. To the north and south is Lavender Walk.
