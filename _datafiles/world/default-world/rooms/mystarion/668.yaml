title: The north road
description: North Road is a wide, well-trodden path that stretches from the bustling
  heart of Mystarion to the wild, untamed lands beyond the city's northern gates.
  Flanked by ancient stone walls and tall, wind-swept trees, the road is lined with
  waystations and merchant stalls selling travel provisions, enchanted maps, and protective
  talismans. The air is filled with the scent of pine and the distant call of birds,
  while the road itself is marked by magical runes that guide and protect travelers.
