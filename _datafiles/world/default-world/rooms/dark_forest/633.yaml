title: The hatchery
description: The Hatchery is a surreal and haunting expanse of darkness and silk.
  The air is thick with the overpowering scent of decay and dampness, while the walls
  and ceiling are obscured by layer upon layer of glistening webbing. Moonlight, filtered
  through the silk, casts eerie, shifting shadows that dance like specters on the
  chamber's walls.
