title: Top of the Mountain
description: Standing atop the Stormshard Mountains, you are struck by a profound
  sense of awe and humility. The world seems both vast and intimate from this vantage
  point, a realm of untold stories and unexplored horizons. The sense of accomplishment
  is palpable, not just in the physical feat of the climb, but in the spiritual journey
  undertaken. Here, on the roof of the world, it feels like a place where earth meets
  sky, where the mysteries of the old, wild world linger, and where every gust of
  wind and every shift in the clouds tells a story of the ancient, rugged bones of
  the earth.
