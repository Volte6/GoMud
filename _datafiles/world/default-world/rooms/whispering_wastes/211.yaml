title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The relentless snowstorm of the Whispering Wastes creates a world of
  white isolation. The sky, a deep twilight, barely penetrates the storm's fury. The
  haunting calls of unseen birds pierce the wind's howl, their cries adding to the
  desolate atmosphere. The ground is a treacherous tapestry of snow and ice, with
  shadowy forms of forgotten shrines dotting the landscape, their eerie presence felt
  more than seen.
