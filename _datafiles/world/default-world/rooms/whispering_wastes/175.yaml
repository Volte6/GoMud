title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A relentless storm rages in the Whispering Wastes, the world lost under
  a blanket of snow. The twilight sky casts a surreal luminescence, and the wind whispers
  secrets of the past. Visibility is reduced to a few feet, each step on the ice-laden
  ground uncertain. In the distance, strange structures and spires rise, their shapes
  distorted by the snowstorm. The cold here is more than a physical sensation; it's
  a stark reminder of the isolation and dangers hidden in this desolate, frozen wilderness.
