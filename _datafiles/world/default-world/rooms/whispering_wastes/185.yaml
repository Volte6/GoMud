zone: Whispering Wastes
title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are dominated by a fierce blizzard, the sky a perpetual
  twilight. The wind weaves a tapestry of ghostly whispers, and visibility is limited
  to just a few feet. The ground is a treacherous blanket of ice, with distant structures
  barely visible through the snowstorm.
