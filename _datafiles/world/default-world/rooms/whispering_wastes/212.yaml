title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard transforms the world into a white
  wilderness. The sky, a canvas of twilight hues, adds a layer of surreal beauty.
  The wind's eerie song is occasionally broken by the distant roar of an ice bear,
  its form a fleeting shadow in the storm. The icy terrain is fraught with hidden
  dangers.
