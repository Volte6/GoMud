title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the grip of a perpetual blizzard, the Whispering Wastes present a
  landscape of desolate beauty. The twilight sky weaves a tapestry of faint light
  over the snow-covered ground. The wind whispers with the echoes of lost civilizations,
  and the icy terrain is a challenging gauntlet. Shadowy outlines of forgotten temples
  and palaces appear like illusions, obscured by the swirling snow.
