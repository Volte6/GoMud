title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The blizzard engulfs everything in a whiteout, the sky a dim, haunting
  twilight. The wind moans, carrying whispers that sound like lost souls. Visibility
  is mere steps away, the ice-slick ground treacherous at every turn. Eerie structures
  emerge faintly in the distance, their outlines blurred by the snow. The cold bites
  deep, embodying the solitude and peril of the Whispering Wastes, a realm for only
  the bold and the brave.
