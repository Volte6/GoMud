title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Amidst the relentless blizzard of the Whispering Wastes, the landscape
  becomes a monochrome world of snow and ice. The sky, a muted tapestry of twilight
  hues, bathes everything in a surreal light. The wind carries with it the whispers
  of forgotten spirits, and the ground is a treacherous bed of ice. In the distance,
  the ruins of ancient structures appear like ghosts, their forms distorted by the
  swirling snow.
