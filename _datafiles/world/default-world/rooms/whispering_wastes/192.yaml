title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A world cloaked in white, the Whispering Wastes are dominated by a ceaseless
  blizzard. The twilight sky above casts a muted light, while the wind's howl is intermixed
  with ghostly whispers. The icy terrain is treacherous, and shadowy shapes of enigmatic
  structures are visible in the distance, obscured by the snow.
