title: Garden Path
description: The path, lined with cobblestones and bordered by tall willows, leads
  steadily towards the garden grounds. Wildflowers occasionally peek between the stones,
  and the subtle fragrance of blooming flowers grows stronger with each step. As the
  trail unfolds, it reveals a vast expanse of organized flower beds, shrubs, and the
  distant sound of trickling water, signaling the heart of the garden.
