title: Frostfang Castle Kitchen
description: Adjacent to the banquet hall, the kitchen of Frostfang Castle is a bustling
  hub of activity and culinary craftsmanship. Dominated by a massive stone hearth,
  its flames constantly stoked, the room is filled with the harmonious clatter of
  pots, pans, and utensils. Wooden countertops, stained with years of use, are laden
  with fresh produce, spices, and an array of ingredients from the region. Chefs and
  kitchen hands move with practiced precision, their coordinated dance a testament
  to countless feasts prepared. Hanging herbs and smoked meats scent the air, while
  the warmth from ovens and stovetops creates a comforting contrast to the castle's
  typically cool ambiance.
