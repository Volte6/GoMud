title: The Old Road
description: As you venture beyond the city's limits and onto the tranquil Frostfang
  countryside, the road briefly splits into a fork. The path is flanked by meadows
  cloaked in pristine, glistening snow, with the occasional rustic cottage peering
  out from behind frosted trees. The distant echoes of laughter and the clinking of
  tankards from the city's taverns give way to the hushed whispers of the winter wind
  and the soft crunch of your boots in the snow.
