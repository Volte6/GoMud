title: The Old Road
description: The trees on either side of the road grow taller and denser, casting
  longer shadows that seem to reach out toward you. The sunlight filtering through
  the leaves takes on a muted, eerie quality, bathing the path in a dim, twilight
  glow. The once-frequent travelers' footprints are now scarce, and the air carries
  a hint of foreboding.
