description: 'To the east, a beacon of hope stands amidst the desolation: a temple
  with tall, stone spires that pierce the gray sky. Its heavy wooden doors are slightly
  ajar, revealing a warm, golden light from within. The faint sound of chanting can
  be heard, and the scent of burning incense wafts out, mingling with the cold air.
  A sign above the entrance reads, Sanctuary of the Benevolent Heart: All Are Welcome.
  A priest in humble robes stands by the entrance, offering bread and warm soup to
  those in need.'
