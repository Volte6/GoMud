title: The Residential District
description: Cobblestone streets, worn smooth by endless travel, meander through the
  district, reminiscent of icy streams. Notably, a slight but noticeable fork leading
  northward captures the observant eye. In this area, lanterns suspended from iron
  posts shed a warm, inviting light, subtly drawing attention to this fork in the
  road, as they illuminate the snowy terrain and the faces of purposeful residents.
  Clad in heavy furs and cloaks, the people of this area exhale brief vapors in the
  chilly air, their footsteps subtly suggesting the presence of a seldom-visited but
  captivating abode discreetly situated near the district's northern exit.
