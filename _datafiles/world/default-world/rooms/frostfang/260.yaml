title: The Residential District
description: Within the district, the thoroughfares, layered in well-trodden cobblestones,
  curve gracefully, echoing the paths of frozen waterways. A slight but apparent split
  towards the north captures discerning eyes. At this point, the glow from lanterns
  dangled on metal posts imparts a soft, inviting luminance, directing focus to this
  diversion, and lighting up the snow-laden ground along with the expressions of the
  purpose-driven residents. Cloaked in thick furs and dense cloaks, these individuals
  create transient plumes in the frosty air with their breaths, their footfalls subtly
  betraying the existence of an intriguing, rarely visited residence nestled near
  the district's northern egress.
