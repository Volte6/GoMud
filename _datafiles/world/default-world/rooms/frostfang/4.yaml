title: Cobblestone Way
description: Further down Cobblestone Way, the path narrows, and the stone walls give
  way to iron-wrought fences, guarding grand manors with snow-covered gardens. The
  bare elms are now interspersed with evergreens, their needles heavy with snow. The
  merchant stalls have transformed into bustling shops, their windows showcasing gleaming
  armor, ornate jewelry, and scrolls filled with knowledge. The lute's melody is now
  joined by the rhythmic beat of a drum, creating a lively tune that beckons you forward.
  The castle's grandeur is undeniable, its massive gates and fortified walls standing
  as a testament to Frostfang's history.
