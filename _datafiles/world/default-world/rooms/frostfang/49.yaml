title: East Wing Storage Closet
description: 'Tucked away in the East Wing, the storage closet is a modest, dimly
  lit space. Its sturdy wooden door, slightly worn at the edges, opens to reveal shelves
  lined with neatly arranged supplies: jars of preserved herbs, rolled parchments,
  and bundles of dried wood for kindling. The scent of aged wood and dried lavender
  permeates the air, while the stone floor, cold to the touch, hints at the closet''s
  seldom use. A single, small window at the top allows a sliver of light, casting
  a muted glow over the room''s contents.'
