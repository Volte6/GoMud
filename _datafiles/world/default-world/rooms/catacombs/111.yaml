title: Inside of the Catacombs
description: Moisture weeps from the stones, and the air is laced with the musty scent
  of mold and the iron tang of ancient rusted iron that once graced the doors of now-vanished
  tombs. The dim, flickering light from your lantern causes the shadows to dance macabrely,
  creating the unsettling illusion of movement just at the periphery of your vision.
  Each step echoes off the damp, stone walls where skeletal remnants peer out from
  shadowed niches, their hollowed gazes following in silent judgment. Amidst this
  eerie atmosphere, you notice a cobweb-covered ladder disappearing into a concealed
  opening in the ceiling. This part of the catacombs feels untamed, as if the living
  are mere trespassers in a realm where the echoes of the departed reign in eternal,
  somber dominion.
