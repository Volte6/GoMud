title: Lake Island
description: The beach stretches out before you, covered in a pristine blanket of
  snow, unmarred by the footprints of previous adventurers. To the north, you can
  see an enticing island on the horizon. However, a closer look reveals a challenging
  terrain, with hints of jagged rocks and turbulent waters surrounding it. It might
  be possible to find a way to that distant island, but it would undoubtedly be a
  perilous journey.
