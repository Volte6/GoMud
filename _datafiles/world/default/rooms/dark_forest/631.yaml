title: Top of the tree
description: From this lofty perch, you can see the entire expanse of the Spider's
  Web Thicket spread out like a haunting tapestry. The massive webs below glisten
  in the moonlight, their silken threads shimmering like a sea of silver. Giant spiders
  skitter about, their movements resembling tiny specters in the night. In the distance,
  the dark forest stretches far into the distance. To the west you can see the winter-locked
  city of Frostfang, and to the east the stormshard mountains, where the city of Mystarion
  resides.
