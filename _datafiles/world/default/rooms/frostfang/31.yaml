title: The Shadow Vault
description: 'The air is cool and slightly damp, with walls of rough-hewn stone that
  bear the marks of age and secrecy. Sparse torches affixed to the walls emit a flickering,
  amber glow, revealing a space filled with wooden chests, clay pots, and ancient
  artifacts. A large, worn tapestry hangs on one wall, depicting a scene that hints
  at forgotten rituals or hidden histories of Frostfang. The room''s very existence
  suggests a dual purpose: a safe haven for those in need from the alley and a repository
  for the temple''s most sacred and guarded treasures.'
