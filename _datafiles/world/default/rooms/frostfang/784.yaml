title: Inside a Residence
description: As you step into this residence, a sense of artistic flair is immediately
  apparent. The room is filled with eclectic decorations, from vibrant, hand-painted
  murals on the walls to an assortment of colorful cushions and throws scattered across
  a low, informal seating area. The light from various candles and lanterns casts
  a warm, inviting glow, and small plants in ornate pots add a touch of greenery.
  An array of musical instruments, from lutes to flutes, rests against one wall, suggesting
  the owner's artistic inclinations. This home feels like a personal retreat, a place
  for creativity and relaxation amidst the harshness of Frostfang.
