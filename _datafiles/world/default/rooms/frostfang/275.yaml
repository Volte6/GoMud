title: Residential Hedge
description: From this vantage point, the backs of the houses are visible, their gardens
  and back doors providing a different perspective of the residents' lives. You can
  catch snippets of conversation, the clatter of dishes, or the laughter of children
  playing, yet these sounds seem distant, muffled by the hedge's dense foliage.
