title: Magic Academy
description: Nestled in the heart of Frostfang, the Magic Academy stands as a beacon
  of ancient wisdom and arcane power amid the icy wilderness. The grand structure,
  built from gleaming white stone and adorned with intricate carvings of mythical
  creatures, rises majestically against the backdrop of snow-capped peaks. Frost-covered
  spires and turrets reach toward the sky, each glistening like a crystalline beacon
  in the winter sun. Inside, the halls are warm and inviting, illuminated by floating
  orbs of soft, magical light.
