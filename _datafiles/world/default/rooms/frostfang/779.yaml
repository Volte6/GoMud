title: The Residential District
description: The cobblestone streets, worn smooth by a myriad of footsteps, weave
  through the district, echoing the meandering paths of frozen rivers. Lanterns perched
  on wrought-iron posts shed a soft, golden light, which dances across the uneven
  snow-covered ground, occasionally revealing patches of worn earth where diligent
  maintenance has lapsed. The ground near the bushes to the north appears worn.
