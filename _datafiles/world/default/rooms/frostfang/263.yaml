title: The Residential District
description: The streets, paved with cobblestone smoothed by countless footsteps,
  wind through the district like frozen rivers. Among these, a subtle but distinct
  divergence to the north draws a keen eye. Here, the lanterns hanging from wrought-iron
  posts cast a soft, golden glow that seems to beckon towards this divergence, illuminating
  the snow-covered ground and the faces of residents moving about with purpose. Wrapped
  in furs and thick cloaks, these inhabitants form fleeting clouds with their breath
  in the cold air, their steps hinting at a less frequented yet intriguing dwelling
  located discreetly near the north exit of the district.
