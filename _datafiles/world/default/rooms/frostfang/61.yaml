title: Frostfire Inn
description: The Frostfire Inn stands as a beacon of warmth and respite amidst Frostfang's
  icy embrace. Its sturdy timbered walls, stained a rich mahogany, rise two stories
  high, with smoke curling invitingly from a stout chimney. Inside, a roaring hearth
  casts a golden glow over well-worn wooden tables and plush chairs, where travelers
  share tales over mugs of steaming mead. The scent of roasted meats and freshly baked
  bread wafts from the kitchen, promising hearty meals to weary souls. Upstairs, cozy
  rooms with thick fur blankets await, offering solace from the chill. With its jovial
  atmosphere and the innkeeper's renowned hospitality, the Frostfire has become a
  beloved haven for both locals and wanderers alike.
