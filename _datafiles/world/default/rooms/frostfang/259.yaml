title: The Residential District
description: The district's roads, blanketed with cobblestones shaped by myriad steps,
  course through like stiffened brooks. Here, a gentle yet clear veering toward the
  north intrigues the observant wanderer. At this divergence, the lanterns affixed
  to metallic stands cast a mellow, inviting illumination, drawing attention to this
  route and lighting the snow-blanketed pavement and the visages of resolute dwellers.
  Garbed in thick fur coats and heavy cloaks, these citizens emit ephemeral puffs
  of breath in the cold atmosphere, their strides discreetly revealing a captivating,
  infrequently visited home tucked away near the district's northern exit.
