title: A Room at the Inn
description: The dim glow of a crackling hearth in one corner bathes the wooden walls
  in a flickering amber light, casting dancing shadows that play across the room.
  A metal rod leans against the hearth, and a rustic, sturdy bed with a soft down
  mattress stands against the opposite wall, adorned with thick blankets and plush
  pillows that invite restful slumber. A small, snow-covered window lets in a gentle,
  wintry breeze, and the room is adorned with tasteful decorations that add a touch
  of charm to the ambiance. It's a perfect haven for weary adventurers seeking respite
  from the cold and a peaceful night's rest in the heart of Frostfang.
