title: Residential Hedge
description: The ground here is a soft tapestry of moss and fallen leaves, a stark
  contrast to the hard cobblestones of the city. Dappled sunlight filters through
  the gaps in the foliage, casting a kaleidoscope of light and shadow that dances
  across the ground and the hedge walls. The air is fresh and earthy, filled with
  the scent of damp wood and greenery, a natural aroma that soothes the senses.
