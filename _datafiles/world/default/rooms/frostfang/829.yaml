title: Soldiers Training Yard
description: Nestled within the fortified city of Frostfang, the training yard near
  the soldiers' barracks is a bustling hub of activity, even amid the biting chill
  of winter. Surrounded by high stone walls, the yard is a stark yet lively contrast
  to the icy landscape beyond. Straw dummies stand in regimented rows, bearing the
  scars of countless practice strikes, while wooden targets line the perimeter, punctuated
  by arrows and throwing axes. The ground, compacted by the constant footfalls of
  soldiers, is dusted with snow, which crunches underfoot as recruits spar and veterans
  drill in disciplined formations. Despite the freezing temperatures, the air is filled
  with the sharp clinks of metal on metal and the gruff commands of instructors, their
  breath visible in the cold. Here, under the watchful eye of the Master-at-Arms,
  warriors are forged, their skills honed against the ever-present backdrop of Frostfang's
  icy embrace.
