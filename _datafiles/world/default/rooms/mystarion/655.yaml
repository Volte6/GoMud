title: The battlements
description: As you peer over the battlements of Mystarion, your eyes fall upon the
  rugged mountainside that plummets towards the Dark Forest, a treacherous path that
  only the most daring adventurers would dare to traverse. The slope is a tapestry
  of jagged rocks, gnarled trees, and treacherous crevices, a stark contrast to the
  lush greenery of the forest below. The air here is heavy with the scent of damp
  earth and decaying leaves, and a chill wind whips through the narrow gorges, sending
  a shiver down your spine.
