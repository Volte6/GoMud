title: Lavender Walk
description: At the north-most end of Lavender Walk, the pathway opens into a charming,
  sun-dappled square, where the fragrance of lavender mingles with the scent of wildflowers
  and fresh herbs. Here, the cottages are slightly larger, their ivy-covered walls
  adorned with hanging baskets of vibrant blooms. Stalls are arranged in a circular
  pattern around a central fountain, which bubbles with water infused with calming,
  magical properties. The light from enchanted lanterns is softer, casting a gentle,
  golden glow that enhances the natural beauty of the area.
