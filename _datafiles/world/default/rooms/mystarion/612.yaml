title: Main road
description: The road itself becomes a cobblestone path, the stones worn smooth by
  centuries of use, each one seemingly placed with intention, leading inexorably towards
  the city gates. Intricate runes and symbols are carved into the stones at irregular
  intervals, glowing faintly with an otherworldly light, guiding the way through the
  increasing fog.
