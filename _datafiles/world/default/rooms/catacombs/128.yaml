title: Inside of the Catacombs
description: Moisture weeps from the stones, and the air is laced with the musty scent
  of mold and the iron tang of ancient rusted iron that once graced the doors of now-vanished
  tombs. The dim, flickering light from your lantern causes the shadows to dance macabrely,
  creating the unsettling illusion of movement just at the periphery of your vision.
  Each step echoes off the damp, stone walls where skeletal remnants peer out from
  shadowed niches, their hollowed gazes following in silent judgment. This part of
  the catacombs feels untamed, as if the living are mere trespassers in a realm where
  the echoes of the departed reign in eternal, somber dominion.
