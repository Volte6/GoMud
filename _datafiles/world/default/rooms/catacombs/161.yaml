title: Incomplete Tunnel
description: The rough-hewn walls of this aborted corridor tell a tale of sudden abandonment,
  with jagged stone and support beams protruding like the ribs of a giant beast. Tools
  of ancient make lay scattered on the ground, left behind in a moment of urgent departure,
  now rusted and covered in the dust of ages. The air here is heavy with the earthy
  scent of undisturbed soil and the mustiness of neglect. The tunnel's end is abrupt,
  a darkened void where the light from the catacombs does not reach, giving the unnerving
  impression of an impenetrable barrier to the unknown. Echoes seem to die a little
  too quickly in this space, as if the very air is reluctant to travel down its length,
  and the shadows cling a bit too greedily to the crevices and corners, hinting at
  secrets that were never meant to be unearthed. There is a hole big enough to crawl
  through.
