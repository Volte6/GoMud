title: Entrance to the Catacombs
description: Beneath the Sanctuary of the Benevolent Heart lies the labyrinthine expanse
  known as the Catacombs. A network of narrow, winding tunnels and chambers, the Catacombs
  are carved from the cold, unyielding stone of Frostfang's bedrock. The air within
  is thick with age and whispers of the past, carrying a palpable weight of reverence
  and mystery. Walls are lined with alcoves, each holding the remains of the departed,
  their final resting places marked with inscriptions and symbols of their beliefs.
  Faintly glowing lanterns, placed at irregular intervals, cast eerie illuminations
  on the ancient bones and artifacts, while the distant echo of dripping water serves
  as a haunting reminder of the passage of time in this sacred underworld.
