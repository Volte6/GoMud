title: Dead end
description: 'Tucked away in the heart of Frostfang''s sprawling slums, a dimly lit
  alleyway meanders from the bustling Beggars Lane. This concealed corner, a world
  apart from the temple''s tranquility, boasts ramshackle shanties crafted from discarded
  wood, rusted metal sheets, and tattered fabric. Makeshift tents of mismatched fabrics
  and fraying ropes dot the gaps between these structures. The uneven ground is littered
  with remnants of daily life: discarded meal bones, worn-out shoes, and glimmers
  from shattered glass. Muffled whispers and subtle movements hint at the precarious
  lives within, hidden deep in the slums, yet a stone''s throw from a place of refuge.'
