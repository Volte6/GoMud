title: Mountain path
description: As the path ascends, the terrain becomes more rugged; the trees thin
  out, giving way to rocky outcrops and steep, craggy inclines. The earth underfoot
  changes to a mix of loose shale and solid stone, and the incline sharpens, challenging
  even the most seasoned travelers.
