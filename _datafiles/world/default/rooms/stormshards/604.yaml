title: Mountain path
description: As you approach the crest of the Stormshard Mountains, the trail becomes
  an arduous climb, pushing you to the limits of your endurance. The air thins, each
  breath a labor, and the biting cold gnaws persistently, an ever-present challenge
  against your resolve. The sky, a vast expanse of cobalt and streaks of amber from
  the rising or setting sun, stretches above in an overwhelming canopy, as if you
  are reaching the very edge of the world.
