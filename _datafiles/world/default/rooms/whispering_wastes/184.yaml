title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard creates a world of endless white.
  The sky, a constant twilight, bathes the snow in an otherworldly light. The wind
  whispers with the voices of the past, and the ground is a dangerous path of ice.
  Distant structures appear like phantoms, shrouded in the swirling snow.
