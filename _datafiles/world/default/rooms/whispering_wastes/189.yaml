title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A perpetual blizzard blankets the Whispering Wastes in white. The sky,
  in a state of eternal twilight, gives the snow a surreal glow. The wind carries
  haunting whispers, and the ground is a perilous sheet of ice. Strange, shadowy structures
  emerge in the distance, their outlines blurred by the snow.
