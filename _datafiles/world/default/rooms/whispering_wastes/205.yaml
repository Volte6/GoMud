title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the heart of the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard's fury is unrelenting.
  The twilight sky broods overhead, casting a dim, spectral light. Through the howling
  wind, faint cries of unseen creatures echo, their forms hidden in the snowstorm.
  The ground is a treacherous labyrinth of ice, with ominous shapes of frozen monoliths
  barely visible in the distance, their surfaces etched with ancient runes.
