title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The world is lost in a sea of white as the blizzard sweeps over the Whispering
  Wastes. The sky, a perpetual dim grey, adds a layer of mystery to the landscape.
  The wind seems to murmur secrets of a forgotten age, and each step is a cautious
  dance on the treacherous, icy ground. In the distance, the remnants of a once-great
  civilization peek through the snow, their shapes warped by the relentless storm.
