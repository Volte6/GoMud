title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A blanket of snow and ice transforms the Whispering Wastes into a realm
  of white. The sky, in twilight gloom, adds a surreal touch, while the wind's eerie
  whispers fill the air. The icy ground is fraught with danger, and shadowy shapes
  of strange structures are barely visible in the distance.
