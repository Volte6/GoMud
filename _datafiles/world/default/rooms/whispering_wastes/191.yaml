title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are a realm of white, the blizzard relentless.
  The twilight sky casts a strange light over the icy landscape. The wind whispers
  with voices from another time, and the treacherous ground is covered in a layer
  of ice. In the distance, bizarre structures stand, their true forms hidden by the
  storm.
