title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Amidst the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard reigns supreme, the sky a
  permanent twilight. The wind's eerie howl is filled with whispers of ancient tales.
  The ground is treacherous with ice, and mysterious structures appear as faint shadows,
  distorted by the storm. The cold is a relentless force, a reminder of the loneliness
  and danger that pervade this barren, frozen landscape.
