title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, snow and wind dominate, the sky a constant
  dusk, shedding a ghostly light over the land. The wind's howl is punctuated by eerie
  whispers, making every shadow seem alive. The ground is a slippery trap of ice,
  and distant, indistinct shapes hint at unknown dangers. The cold here is more than
  physical; it's a chilling reminder of the desolation surrounding you, a test for
  the daring and a trap for the unwary.
