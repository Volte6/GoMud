title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Enveloped in a never-ending blizzard, the Whispering Wastes stretch out
  in a vista of stark white. The sky, a dusky twilight, casts an ethereal sheen over
  the snow-clad terrain. The wind carries elusive whispers, hinting at long-lost tales.
  Beneath your feet, the ice-laden ground threatens with hidden perils, while the
  silhouettes of ancient, frost-covered ruins rise and fall in the swirling snow.
