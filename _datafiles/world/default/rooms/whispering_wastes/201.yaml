title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are a land of endless snow, the blizzard an unyielding
  force. The sky, a dim twilight, casts long, eerie shadows over the landscape. The
  wind carries with it the faint sounds of ancient chants, and the ground is an icy
  trap waiting to ensnare the unwary. Distant, strange spires and arches rise from
  the snow, their true nature hidden by the ceaseless storm.
