title: Lake Island
description: The island's surface is covered in a soft blanket of snow, untouched
  by the footprints of those who have ventured here before you. Tall, ancient pine
  trees stand sentinel, their branches heavy with snow and icicles that shimmer like
  crystal chandeliers in the gentle breeze.
