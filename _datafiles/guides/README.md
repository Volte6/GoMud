# Guides

- [Running GoMud](running/README.md)
- [Playing GoMud](playing/README.md)
- [World Building](building/README.md)
  - [Scripting](building/scripting/README.md)
- [Translation](translation/README.md)

## TODO

- Disambiguate between running from cloned source files and running a downloaded release.
- Move from `go run .` to `go build -o my-output-binary` and running that. This helps with the above.
- Further sectionalize the various guides and help them make sense now that they are fragmented from an original single guide
- Add a TOC to each `.md` file to help navigate sections quicker when looking for key information.
- Consider making guides loadable/viewable either in world or via the admin web interface.
