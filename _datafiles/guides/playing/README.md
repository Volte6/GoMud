# Navigating Around the Built-In World

Exploring GoMUD's built-in world is straightforward. Here are the key commands to help you navigate and interact:

#### a. Moving Between Rooms

Use directional commands to move:

```
north
south
east
west
up
down
```

For example, if you are in "The Main Hall" and want to move north to "The Library," simply type:

```
north
```

To ascend stairs from "The Library" to "The Attic," type:

```
up
```

#### b. Inspecting Your Surroundings

To get a detailed description of your current location, use:

```
look
```
You can also type
``look <direction>`` to peer one room in that direction

If you have multiple identical items in a room or in your inventory, you can interact with specific ones by appending a number to the item name. For example, if you have two letters and want to read the first, type:

```
read letter
```

To read the second letter, type:

```
read letter#2
```

#### c. Discovering Available Commands

To see a list of commands you can use, type:

```
help
```

#### d. Managing Your Inventory and Stats

Check what items you are carrying or view your character's stats with:

```
inventory
stats
```

These commands will help you fully immerse yourself in the world of GoMUD.
