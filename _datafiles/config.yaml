#
#   CONFIGURATION FILE
#   This file contains all of the configuration options for the game.
#   You can change these options to customize the game to your liking.
#
#   Note: If you decide to use a custom config.yaml, it is recommended that you
#   copy only the properties you want to change of this file into your own
#   config.yaml.
#   When running the server, use the environment variable: CONFIG_PATH like so:
#   CONFIG_PATH=../mudfiles/config.yaml to specify where your custom config file
#   can be found.
#
#   This way when you update the server, your custom config file will not be
#   overwritten.
#
#   Note: The name/value pairs are hierarchical, nested under other values.
#   This means you must tab out values that belong under a namespace.
#   For example: MudName is tabbed out two spaces from Server
#   Alternatively, you can specify it using a dot-syntax in your overrides file:
#   Server.MudName: "GoMud"
#

#
#   SERVER CUSTOMIZATIONS
#   Small changes such as login commands and the seed can ensure your mud has
#   differences from others on the same code base.
#
################################################################################
Server:
  # - MudName -
  #   Display name of the MUD.
  #   This will be used a few places by default (such as the web pages).
  MudName: "GoMud"
  # - Seed -
  #   The seed used for certain types of content generation
  #   To prevent certain secrets or content from being spoiled, you can set this
  #   to a random string.
  #   Note: Once the Mud has been played and data saved, changing this will
  #   probably break certain things that get saved to files, such as user KeyRings,
  #   so only set it before the first time you run the server.
  Seed: "Mud"
  # - MaxCPUCores -
  #   Maximum CPU cores to use. 0 for all available cores.
  #   Most of the game is single threaded, but there are a few things that can
  #   benefit from multiple cores, such as the web server and telnet server.
  MaxCPUCores: 0
  # - OnLoginCommands -
  #   Commands to run when a user logs in. These commands are run by the user
  #   and can be anything they have access to.
  OnLoginCommands:

  # This number is auto-updated to the highest number of rooms in the game.
  #   If creating your own rooms but don't want to risk an update conflicting,
  #   update this to a large number (like 100000), so that as new rooms are
  #   created they will be far beyond the range of any room id's expected through
  #   a code update.
  NextRoomId: 1002
  # - Locked -
  #   All config names defined here are immutable to the `server set` admin
  #   command. They can only be changed by editing the config file directly.
  #   It is a good idea to lock configs related to folder/file paths to prevent

#   MEMORY/CPU OPTIMIZATIONS
#   Changes that can help reduce memory and CPU usage.
#
################################################################################
Memory:
  # - MaxMobBoredom -
  #   How many rounds a mob can go without seeing a player before a mob despawns.
  #   This is mainly a resource management feature to keep the game from getting
  #   bogged down with too many mobs in memory. If you want mobs to stick around
  #   indefinitely, set this to 0. Certain mobs may never despawn, however.
  MaxMobBoredom: 250
  # - MobUnloadThreshold -
  #   Do not unload any bots if the in-memory count is under this threshold.
  MobUnloadThreshold: 100
  # - RoomUnloadRounds -
  #   How many rounds must pass without a visitor before a room is considered
  #   for unloading from memory.
  RoomUnloadRounds: 450
  # - RoomUnloadThreshold -
  #   Do not unload any rooms if the in-memory count is under this threshold.
  RoomUnloadThreshold: 200

################################################################################
#
#   LOOT GOBLIN CONFIGURATIONS
#   This is a special mob that cleans up items and gold left on the ground.
#   It portals in from a special zone and when it can't find any items or gold
#   to pick up, it portals back.
#   Players can actually chase the goblin to its realm and possibly find some
#   treasure.
#
################################################################################
LootGoblin:
  # - RoomId -
  #   The room the loot goblin spawns in (per its spawninfo). Also the room it returns
  #   to to drop off loot it finds. If zero (0), no loot goblin spawning.
  RoomId: 139
  # - RoundCount -
  #   How often the Loot Goblin will spawn. It is a good idea to keep this
  #   number low to keep the game from getting bogged down with too many items
  #   on the ground. At 4 seconds per round, 900 rounds is 1 hour.
  RoundCount: 900
  # - MinimumItems -
  #   How many items there must be on the room to attract the loot goblin
  MinimumItems: 3
  # - MinimumGold -
  #   How much gold there must be on the room to attract the loot goblin
  MinimumGold: 100
  # - IncludeRecentRooms -
  #   If true, the loot goblin will also clean recently visited by players rooms
  #   If allowed, this could create a situation where a lot of loot drops and the
  #   suddenly the goblin shows up.
  IncludeRecentRooms: true

#
#   ENGINE TIMING
#   Fine tuning for input throttling, round time, day length etc.
#
################################################################################
Timing:
  # - TurnMs -
  #   How many milliseconds per turn. While lower is generally better, this can
  #   greatly increase overhead on the server - a command per mob or user is
  #   processed per turn. This is not the same as rounds, which is how often the
  #   mobs choose their actions, but if multiple actions are queued up, they will
  #   be processed in order once per turn.
  #   50 is a good balance between handling input from players and not bogging
  #   down the server.
  #   Note: If your automapper/walker seems slow, this is probably the culprit.
  TurnMs: 50
  # - RoundSeconds -
  #   How many seconds per round. Anything gated by rounds will be affected by
  #   this. This is the main setting for controlling the pace of the game.
  RoundSeconds: 4
  # - RoundsPerAutoSave -
  #   How often the server will automatically save the game state. This is a
  #   backup feature in case the server crashes. The game state is also saved
  #   whenever the server is shut down.
  RoundsPerAutoSave: 225
  # - RoundsPerDay -
  #   How many rounds are in a day? This is used to calculate the time of day.
  #   The lower this number, the faster the day/night cycle will be.
  #   A 4 second round and a 900 round day means the day/night cycle is 1 hour.
  RoundsPerDay: 900
  # - NightHours -
  #   How many hours of each 24 hour day will be nighttime?
  NightHours: 8

  #   Leave blank if no CDN config or similar desired
  WebCDNLocation: ""
  # - DataFiles -
  #   The folder where all datafiles reside.
  #   If you are planning to create your own world, copying the current folder

  # - ConsistentAttackMessages -
  #   If true, each weapon ID will consistently use the same message for each type

  #   Note: This is not case sensitive.
  #   You can add a * to the end of a name to ban all names that start with that
  #   name. For example, "admin*" would ban "admin", "administrator", etc.
  #   You can also use * at the beginning of a name to ban all names that
  #   end with that name. For example, "*admin" would ban "admin", "superadmin",
  #   Finally, you can use * at the beginning and end of a name to ban all names
  #   that contain that name. For example, "*admin*" would ban "admin", "superadmin",

#     - "admin" - Has all admin commands
#   Role sub-commands should be separated by a dot: room.info
#   Roles are more permissive the more they prefix.
#   Example: room prefixes room.info so would permit that action as well.
#   Role checks must be implemented wherever role-based restriction is desired:
