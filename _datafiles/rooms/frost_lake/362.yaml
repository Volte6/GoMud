zone: Frost Lake
title: Old Dock
description: The dock stretches a short distance into the lake, its wooden planks
  creaking softly with every step. Some boards have rotted away, leaving gaps that
  hint at the lake's depths below. A railing, partially covered in frost and ice,
  runs along the sides, offering a frail sense of security to those who venture out.
