title: Lake Island
description: The beach stretches out before you, covered in a pristine blanket of
  snow, unmarred by the footprints of previous adventurers. To the south, you can
  see an enticing island on the horizon. However, a closer look reveals a treacherous
  terrain, with jagged rocks and turbulent waters surrounding it. It seems like a
  perilous journey to attempt crossing to that distant island.
