title: Frost Lake Rocks
description: You stand atop a large rock a ways from the shore of Frost Lake. The
  frigid waters are violently churning below you, their surface a dark, foreboding
  shade of blue. The rock is slick with ice, and the wind howls around you, carrying
  with it the scent of pine and the promise of snow. The view from here is breathtaking,
  but the danger is palpable. One wrong step could send you tumbling into the icy
  depths below. The only way back is to the southeast, where occasionally you can
  see the water become shallow enough to wade back to shore.
