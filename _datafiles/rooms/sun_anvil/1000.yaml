title: Desert's Edge
description: You find yourself at the threshold of the Sun Anvil Desert, where the
  air itself seems to shimmer under the relentless glare of a merciless sun. The ground
  is a mosaic of cracked earth, each fissure like a vein on the anvil of a colossal
  forge. Scant tufts of parched grasses cling stubbornly to life amidst the barren
  sands. Jagged rock formations jut from the landscape, their shadows offering little
  respite from the heat. The horizon wavers, distorted by heat mirages that blur the
  line between sky and sand. A dry wind brushes against your face, carrying with it
  the faint scent of hot stone and a distant, haunting whisper of challenges that
  lie ahead. creatures.
