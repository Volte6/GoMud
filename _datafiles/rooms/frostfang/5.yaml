title: Cobblestone Way
description: Almost at the end of Cobblestone Way, the stones paventment underfoot
  is slick with ice, reflecting the soft glow of lanterns that line the path. The
  trees have receded, replaced by statues of figures posed in moments of triumph,
  each one covered in a layer of frost. The music is now a symphony, with flutes and
  violins joining the lute and drum, creating a melody that speaks of hope and destiny.
  The castle's entrance is just ahead, its massive doors adorned with intricate carvings.
