title: Frostwarden Rangers
description: The headquarters of the Frostwarden Rangers is a blend of rugged practicality
  and respect for the wild. Dark timber walls showcase maps and organized weaponry,
  while a central stone table, illuminated by an antler chandelier, serves as the
  hub for strategy discussions. Alcoves offer fur-lined bunks for rest, and shelves
  brim with scrolls detailing Frostfang's nature and lore. The ever-present scent
  of pine and leather mingles with the smoky warmth of a constantly burning hearth,
  embodying the guild's vigilant spirit.
