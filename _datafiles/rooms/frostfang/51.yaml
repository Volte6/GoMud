title: East Wing Storage Closet
description: Hidden within the depths of Frostfang Castle, the storage closet is a
  compact, dimly lit chamber. Upon opening its heavy wooden door, one is immediately
  met with the musty scent of old parchment and aged wood. Rows of wooden shelves,
  darkened by time, stretch from floor to ceiling, mostly empty. A lantern hangs on
  the wall, but doesn't appear to be in working order. As you step inside, faint murmurs,
  their origin unclear, seem to echo from the walls or perhaps beyond them, adding
  an air of mystery to the room's quiet seclusion.
