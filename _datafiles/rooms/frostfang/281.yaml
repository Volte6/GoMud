title: The Old Road
description: You leave behind the city's borders and enter the tranquil Frostfang
  countryside. The road is flanked by meadows blanketed in pristine, glistening snow,
  and the occasional rustic cottage peeks out from behind frosted trees. The distant
  echoes of laughter and the clinking of tankards from the city's taverns are replaced
  by the hushed whispers of the winter wind and the soft crunch of your boots in the
  snow.
