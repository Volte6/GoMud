title: The Old Road
description: As you stand at the fork in the road, your choices become apparent. To
  the northwest, the path that was once blocked and now cleared beckons you, with
  a broken-down caravan in the distance, its skeletal frame a testament to past travelers'
  misfortune. To the east, the foreboding presence of the Dark Forest looms, its dense,
  snowy trees casting long shadows over a worn and overgrown road.
