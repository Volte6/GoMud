title: The West Gate
description: The West Gate of Frostfang stands as a formidable sentinel at the terminus
  of the West Road. Crafted from massive blocks of gray stone, it's adorned with intricate
  frost patterns and ancient runes. Two towering statues of guardian beasts flank
  the gate, their stone eyes seeming to watch over all who pass. Beyond the gate,
  the vast expanse of the frozen tundra stretches out, its icy plains shimmering under
  the pale light, offering both a breathtaking view and a stark reminder of the harsh
  wilderness that lies just beyond Frostfang's protective walls.
