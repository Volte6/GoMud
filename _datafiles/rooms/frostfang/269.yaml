title: Inside a Residence
description: This residence exudes a feeling of old-world luxury and refinement. The
  floors are covered with plush, deep-red carpets, and the walls are draped in rich,
  embroidered tapestries, depicting historic battles and legendary heroes of Frostfang.
  Heavy, carved wooden furniture, including a massive four-poster bed and an ornately
  decorated wardrobe, fill the bedroom. The main living area features a large, stone
  hearth with a roaring fire, over which hangs a family crest. Intricate stained glass
  windows add a colorful play of light to the room, and a small but well-stocked bar
  suggests a taste for fine spirits and leisurely evenings spent in quiet conversation.
