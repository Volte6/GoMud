title: The Castle Gates
description: Standing at the castle gates of Frostfang, Cobblestone Way concludes
  its winding journey. The towering doors loom above you, their dark wood and iron
  bindings covered in a layer of frost. Torchlight flickers from the walls, casting
  shadows that dance and play on the snow-covered ground. From within the castle,
  the sound of music reaches your ears, a beautiful melody that seems to beckon you
  closer.
