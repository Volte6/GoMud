title: Steelwhisper Armory
description: 'Tucked into a stone-clad corner of Frostfang, the Steelwhisper Armory
  stands as a testament to the town''s martial heritage. Its robust oak door, branded
  with the emblem of twin crossed swords, opens to reveal walls lined with meticulously
  crafted weapons, from razor-sharp daggers to imposing battle-axes. Adjacent stands
  are draped with armors of varying designs: chainmail shimmering like liquid silver,
  plate armor cold and unyielding, and leather pieces imbued with protective runes.
  The rhythmic sound of hammering echoes from the back, where the master blacksmith,
  known for melding ancient techniques with innovative designs, forges masterpieces.
  For warriors and guardians of Frostfang, Steelwhisper is not just a shop, but a
  bastion of defense and honor.'
