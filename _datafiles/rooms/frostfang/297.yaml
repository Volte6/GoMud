title: The Old Road
description: The towering trees now form a dense, impenetrable barrier, their branches
  intertwining overhead to create an ominous canopy. The road itself becomes increasingly
  overgrown, with moss-covered cobblestones peeking through the underbrush. The distant
  sounds of civilization are but a distant memory, replaced by an unsettling silence
  that seems to emanate from the heart of the forest.
