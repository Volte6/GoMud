title: The Southern Road
description: As you continue along the path, you catch glimpses of the Frost Lake
  through gaps in the trees. Its icy expanse glistens like a mirror in the distance,
  beckoning you closer with its mystical allure. The road gradually slopes downward,
  leading you toward the shores of the lake.
