title: Inside a Residence
description: As you step inside the residence, warmth envelops you, a stark contrast
  to the biting cold of Frostfang's streets. The interior exudes a rustic charm, with
  thick wooden beams supporting the low ceiling and walls adorned with tapestries
  depicting scenes of snow-covered forests and mythical creatures. The floor is covered
  with woven rugs, soft underfoot, adding splashes of color to the otherwise earthy
  tones of the room.
