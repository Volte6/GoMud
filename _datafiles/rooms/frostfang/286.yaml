title: The Southern Road
description: The Southern Road is flanked by ancient, snow-covered trees, their gnarled
  branches reaching out like skeletal fingers against the white canvas of the land.
  The path itself is a narrow trail, partially obscured by layers of snow, with the
  occasional set of footprints, both human and animal, marking the way.
