title: Broken Caravan
description: The skeletal frames of shattered wagons, their wheels sunken into the
  icy ground, create a somber tableau. Amidst the wreckage, you notice tattered and
  frost-covered canvas awnings that once provided shelter for weary travelers and
  valuable cargo. The contents of crates and barrels are strewn about, their wares
  now plundered by time and the elements.
