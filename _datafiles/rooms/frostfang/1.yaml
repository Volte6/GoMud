title: Town Square
description: In the shimmering heart of Frostfang, a city wrapped in a perpetual blanket
  of snow and illuminated by the ethereal glow of the auroras, lies the Town Square.
  Your gaze is drawn to a prominent sign adorned with a detailed map, providing an
  essential guide to the area's layout. You find yourself amidst the hustle and bustle
  of the Square, where icicle-laden stalls display wares from around the frozen realm,
  and citizens clad in thick furs exchange stories of their encounters with mystical
  creatures.
