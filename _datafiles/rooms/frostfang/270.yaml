title: Soldiers Barracks
description: The Soldiers Barracks in Frostfang is a bastion of military discipline
  and camaraderie, standing solid and imposing with its stone walls and heavy wooden
  doors. Upon entering, the air is filled with a blend of leather, metal, and the
  faint scent of wood smoke from the central hearth that heats the large communal
  area.
