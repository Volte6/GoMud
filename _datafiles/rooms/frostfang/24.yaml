title: Dark alley
description: 'Adjacent to the Sanctuary of the Benevolent Heart, a narrow, shadowed
  alleyway snakes away from the main thoroughfare of Beggars Lane. This hidden crevice
  of Frostfang is a stark contrast to the temple''s solemnity. Ramshackle shanties,
  pieced together from discarded wood, rusted metal sheets, and tattered cloth, huddle
  closely together, as if seeking warmth from one another. Makeshift tents, crafted
  from mismatched fabrics and reinforced with fraying ropes, dot the gaps between
  the shanties. The ground is uneven, littered with remnants of daily life: discarded
  bones from meager meals, worn-out shoes, and the occasional glint of a broken bottle.
  Faint whispers and the soft rustling of movement can be heard from within the shelters,
  hinting at the lives precariously balanced in this hidden enclave, a stone''s throw
  away from a place of worship and refuge.'
