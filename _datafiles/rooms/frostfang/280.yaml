title: The Old Road
description: The old dirt road stretches ahead of you, its path well-trodden by countless
  travelers over the years. Here, the city's influence is still felt, with buildings
  gradually giving way to open fields on either side of the road. The air is filled
  with the distant sounds of the city's activities fading into the serene countryside.
