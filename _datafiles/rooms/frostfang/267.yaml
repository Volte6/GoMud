title: Inside a Residence
description: This residence strikes you with its practical, yet homely feel. The main
  room is spacious, with a high ceiling supported by visible rafters, from which dried
  herbs and garlic hang, filling the air with a comforting aroma. The furniture is
  sturdy and functional, made of pine, giving the room a light, airy feel. A large
  kitchen area dominates one end, showcasing an impressive array of cooking tools
  and a large, well-used wooden table, suggesting this is a home that values hearty
  meals and communal cooking. Simple, hand-sewn curtains frame the windows, and a
  collection of hand-made pottery and local artwork gives the space a personal, lived-in
  atmosphere.
