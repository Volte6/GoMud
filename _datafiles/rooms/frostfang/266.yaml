title: Inside a Residence
description: Upon entering this residence, you're greeted by an air of sophisticated
  warmth, a welcome reprieve from Frostfang's icy exterior. The interior boasts elegant,
  dark wood paneling and floors polished to a high sheen, reflecting the flickering
  light from an ornate fireplace. The walls are lined with bookshelves, filled with
  ancient tomes and curious artifacts from distant lands, hinting at the owner's scholarly
  pursuits. Plush velvet curtains drape over the windows, and a grand chandelier hangs
  from the ceiling, casting a soft, ambient glow over the room. In the center, a large
  oak table surrounded by high-backed chairs suggests a space where intellectual debates
  and plans for adventure are equally at home.
