title: Cobblestone Way
description: As you continue along Cobblestone Way, the stone walls on either side
  seem to grow taller, their mossy exteriors now adorned with icicles that shimmer
  in the pale sunlight. The elms overhead are bare, their branches covered in a blanket
  of snow, glistening like silver. The stone houses become fewer, replaced by small
  merchant stalls displaying woolen fabrics and frosty trinkets. The scent of freshly
  baked bread mingles with the crisp, cold air, and the distant sound of a lute grows
  louder, its notes now accompanied by the soft hum of voices. The castle of Frostfang,
  once a distant silhouette, now stands larger and more defined against the snowy
  backdrop, its stone walls and turrets standing as silent witnesses to the city's
  storied past.
