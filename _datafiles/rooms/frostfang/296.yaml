description: Before you lies the Frost Lake in all its glory. The ice is so clear
  and pristine that it's almost like walking on a sheet of glass. Sunlight dances
  upon the frozen surface, creating an ever-shifting kaleidoscope of colors that ripple
  and play across the ice, like a living canvas painted by the gods.
