title: Bank of Frostfang
description: The bank of Frostfang stands as a bastion of security and order amidst
  the bustling commerce of the city. Its walls, built from the same enduring stone
  that fortifies the city's ramparts, rise stoically against the frostbitten sky.
  The heavy wooden doors, reinforced with iron bands and studs, open to reveal an
  interior that is both grand and austere. Inside, the air is tinged with the scent
  of ink and parchment, and the sound of coins clinking resonates softly in the hushed
  atmosphere.
