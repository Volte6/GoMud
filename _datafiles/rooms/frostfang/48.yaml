title: Frostfang Library
description: The Frostfang Castle library, ensconced within the West Wing, is a blend
  of rugged tradition and quiet curiosity. Dark stone walls enclose shelves laden
  with leather-bound tomes, scrolls wrapped in animal skins, and rare texts from distant
  lands. Thick pelts cover the floor, offering warmth against the cold, while a grand
  stone fireplace serves as the room's heart, its flames flickering amidst wooden
  chairs and tables. Amidst this stark simplicity, an ornate astrolabe stands in a
  corner, symbolizing the region's enduring thirst for knowledge and the mysteries
  of the cosmos.
