title: Bank Vault
description: The Bank of Frostfang Vault, upon closer inspection, reveals itself as
  a modest chamber, quite unassuming compared to the grandeur one might expect. The
  air inside is cool and slightly musty, suggesting infrequent use. Sparse light filters
  in from above, casting long, slanting shadows across the room. The walls, made of
  thick, sturdy stone, are lined with a handful of small, reinforced steel safes,
  most of which stand open and empty, their contents likely transferred to more secure
  locations. In the center of the room, a sturdy table holds a few scattered coins
  and bits of jewelry, remnants of transactions in progress or items awaiting relocation.
