title: Poorly Lit Street
description: Tucked away in the heart of Frostfang's sprawling slums, a dimly lit
  alleyway meanders from the bustling Beggars Lane. This concealed corner, a world
  apart from the temple's tranquility, boasts ramshackle shanties crafted from discarded
  wood, rusted metal sheets, and tattered fabric. Makeshift tents of mismatched fabrics
  and fraying ropes dot the gaps between these structures. The sewers drain out of
  the canal here, through a rusted grate. The unthinkable slime, filth, and stench
  of the cities denizens repulses you.
