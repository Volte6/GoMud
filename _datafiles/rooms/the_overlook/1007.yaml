title: The Red Bathroom
description: The Red Bathroom is a striking, almost surreal space, with walls, floors,
  and fixtures bathed in a deep, glossy red. The walls are smooth and seamless, their
  reflective surface giving the room an otherworldly glow under the soft, white lighting.
  The sinks are mounted in a long, angular countertop that matches the room’s bold
  color, with chrome faucets and fittings standing out as the only contrast. Opposite
  the sinks, a row of stalls with doors painted in the same intense red maintains
  the room’s uniformity. The tiled floor is polished to a mirror-like sheen, amplifying
  the vibrant tone that saturates the space. Despite its bold design, the room exudes
  a strange and unsettling stillness, as though it holds secrets beyond its glossy
  surfaces.
