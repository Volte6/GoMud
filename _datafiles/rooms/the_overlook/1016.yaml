title: Eastern side of the Overlook
description: The parking lot of the Overlook Hotel stretches out before you, lined
  with parking spaces on weathered asphalt. Cracks and patches mark the ground, telling
  tales of harsh winters and the passage of time. The hotel's imposing structure rises
  in the distance, its numerous windows reflecting the overcast sky. The main entrance
  to the hotel is just ahead, its doors a gateway to the unknown.
