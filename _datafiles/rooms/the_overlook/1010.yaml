title: Hallway Continued
description: 'The hallway stretches in both directions, its floor covered in the familiar
  geometric carpet of interlocking burnt orange and deep red patterns, bordered with
  stark black lines. The walls are painted a muted beige, broken by evenly spaced
  doors, each numbered with small brass plaques. At one end of the corridor, a single
  door stands out: 237, its digits slightly tarnished and unevenly lit by the faint
  glow of a wall sconce just above. The door is painted a dull cream color, its surface
  marred by faint scuffs and scratches, as if touched by many hesitant hands. The
  brass handle gleams faintly, polished smooth from use. The air in the hallway feels
  heavier here, an almost imperceptible chill emanating from the doorway, making the
  otherwise still corridor feel unnaturally charged.'
