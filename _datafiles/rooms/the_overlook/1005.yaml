title: General Manager's Office
description: The General Managerâ€™s Office is a modestly sized room with an air of
  quiet authority. The walls are painted a bold orange, their color striking against
  the darker furnishings in the room. A large wooden desk occupies the center of the
  space, its surface orderly, with a green desk lamp, a stack of papers, and a leather-bound
  notebook neatly arranged. Behind the desk, a high-backed leather chair sits against
  a wall lined with built-in bookshelves, their contents a mix of binders, ledgers,
  and well-worn books. A small window to one side allows a view of the grounds, its
  glass slightly fogged. A metal filing cabinet stands in the corner, its drawers
  labeled in precise, handwritten script. The carpet beneath your feet is dark and
  thick, muffling every step in this vibrant yet purposeful space.
