title: Walk-in Freezer
description: The walk-in freezer is a stark, frigid space where the air bites at exposed
  skin. Metal shelves line the walls, stocked with an assortment of frozen meats,
  vegetables, and other provisions, each package neatly labeled and covered in a fine
  layer of frost. The floor is smooth concrete, its surface slick in spots from condensation.
  A faint hum emanates from the overhead cooling unit, which pulses periodically as
  it maintains the icy temperature. The metal door is thick and heavy, equipped with
  a large latch and a release handle on the inside. The light above casts a cold,
  sterile glow, reflecting off the frost-covered surfaces and creating an almost otherworldly
  stillness.
