description: The lobby of the Overlook Hotel greets you with an expansive, open space,
  floored with polished wood that gleams under the soft lighting. To your left, a
  grand staircase curves upward, leading to the floors above. The reception desk stands
  ahead, an imposing structure of dark wood, behind which hangs a large, ornate clock.
  To the right, plush armchairs and sofas are arranged in inviting clusters, surrounding
  a stone fireplace that dominates the far wall.
