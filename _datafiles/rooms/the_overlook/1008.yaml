title: The Colorado Room
description: 'The Colorado Room is a sprawling, high-ceilinged space dominated by
  its rustic charm. Wooden beams stretch across the ceiling, their dark grain contrasting
  with the pale plaster walls. A massive stone fireplace anchors the far end of the
  room, its hearth large enough to stand in, framed by carved wooden panels that depict
  mountain scenes. The center of the room is occupied by a grand table of polished
  oak, surrounded by heavy chairs with intricate carvings on their backs and legs.
  Rows of tall windows line one wall, their glass panes offering a view of the surrounding
  landscape. Most of the walls are adorned with black-and-white photographs in simple
  wooden frames, each capturing moments from decades past: gatherings, celebrations,
  and solemn portraits of former visitors and staff. The polished wooden floor reflects
  the light, adding a warm glow to the expansive space.'
