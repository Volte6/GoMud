title: Room 237
description: The air in Room 237 feels heavier, as though it holds onto secrets too
  old to tell. The walls are covered in faded floral wallpaper, its once vibrant colors
  now dulled with time and neglect. A single bed sits against the far wall, its brass
  frame tarnished and its bedding neatly made, though a faint musty odor lingers.
  A clawfoot bathtub occupies the bathroom, its porcelain exterior cracked and stained,
  while the shower curtain hangs slightly askew. A heavy dresser with a cracked mirror
  leans slightly against the opposite wall, its drawers closed but not flush. The
  carpet is deep red, its fibers worn in uneven paths as if tread by countless unseen
  visitors.
