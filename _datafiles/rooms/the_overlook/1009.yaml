title: Hallway
description: The hallway stretches endlessly in both directions, its floor covered
  in the iconic geometric carpet pattern of burnt orange and deep red interlocking
  shapes, bordered by stark black lines. The walls are lined with pale, off-white
  paneling, interrupted at intervals by numbered doors, each painted a uniform beige
  and accented with brass handles. Dim, flickering wall sconces cast uneven pools
  of light, leaving portions of the hallway in shadow. The ceiling is low, amplifying
  a sense of confinement, while the faint hum of an unseen ventilation system fills
  the space with a droning monotony. The carpet beneath your feet feels plush but
  worn, as if countless footsteps have trodden the same path, their stories absorbed
  into the fibers.
