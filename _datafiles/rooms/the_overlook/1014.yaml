description: The kitchen is a sprawling, industrial space filled with rows of stainless
  steel countertops and appliances. Large ovens and stovetops line one wall, their
  surfaces gleaming with a mix of wear and meticulous cleaning. Overhead, steel racks
  hold an assortment of pots, pans, and utensils, each organized by size and function.
  In the center of the room, a massive butcher block table serves as a workstation,
  its surface marked with countless knife scars. Refrigerators and freezers hum softly
  along the back wall, their bulk imposing. The faint smell of aged grease and spices
  lingers in the air, mingling with the sterile scent of cleaning solutions. Shelves
  stocked with dry goods and ingredients line the far corner, a testament to the hotel's
  capacity for grand feasts.
