title: Dark Acolyte's Chamber
description: This sacred room is illuminated by the ghostly glow of greenish-blue
  flames that flicker from wall-mounted braziers, casting long, dancing shadows across
  the walls, which are etched with forgotten runes and the faces of the long-departed.
  At the center stands a black stone altar, encrusted with dark crystals that pulse
  with an otherworldly energy. Here, the dark acolyte, cloaked in midnight robes,
  meditates, his eyes reflecting the cryptic light, waiting to impart forbidden knowledge
  to those daring enough to seek it. Skeleton sentinels line the perimeter, their
  bony fingers clutching rusted weapons, forever guarding the secrets contained within
  these ancient stones.
