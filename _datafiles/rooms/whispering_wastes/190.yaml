title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard obscures the world in a veil of
  white. The sky, a twilight grey, creates an eerie atmosphere. The wind howls with
  faint, ghostly echoes, and the ice-covered ground challenges every step. Distant
  structures appear as distorted shadows through the swirling snow.
