title: Strange Obelisk
description: Just outside of the entrance to the mirror caves stands an ancient obelisk,
  its surface etched with mysterious runes that glow faintly with an otherworldly
  light. The obelisk is partially buried in a mound of snow, but its presence exudes
  an eerie sense of foreboding. The sky above is a turbulent swirl of grey clouds,
  and the ground crunches underfoot with each step, the stillness broken only by the
  whispering wind and the distant echoes of unseen creatures within the caves.
