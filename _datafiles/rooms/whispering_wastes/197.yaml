zone: Whispering Wastes
title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are a realm of eternal winter, where the sky remains
  locked in a state of twilight gloom. The wind whispers with the voices of the past,
  weaving a chilling symphony. The icy terrain is fraught with danger, and distant,
  bizarre edifices stand as frozen sentinels, their details lost to the blizzard's
  fury.
