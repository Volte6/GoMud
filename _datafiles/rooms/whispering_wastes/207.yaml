title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Amidst the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard weaves a white tapestry, the
  sky a dim echo of daylight. The wind's mournful cry carries the distant roar of
  ice dragons, their presence felt but unseen. The ground is a minefield of snowdrifts
  and hidden crevasses.
