title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the heart of the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard is unrelenting. The
  sky, trapped in twilight, casts a dim light over the snowy expanse. The wind's howl
  carries faint, otherworldly whispers, and the ground is a hazardous path of ice.
  Mysterious structures loom in the distance, their forms obscured by the swirling
  snow.
