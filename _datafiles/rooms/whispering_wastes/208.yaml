title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are a symphony of white, the blizzard a relentless
  conductor. The twilight sky casts a gloomy pall over the snow-clad terrain. In the
  distance, the ghostly howls of snow beasts blend with the wind's whispers, creating
  an eerie chorus. The ground, covered in a thick layer of snow, hides treacherous
  icy patches.
