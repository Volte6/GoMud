title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The relentless snowstorm of the Whispering Wastes engulfs everything
  in white. Under a twilight sky, the landscape becomes an endless expanse of snow
  and ice. The howling wind carries ghostly whispers, and the ground is treacherous
  with ice. Strange structures and frozen spires appear as shadows, their forms distorted
  by the snow.
