title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the grip of a perpetual blizzard, the Whispering Wastes are a vision
  of white desolation under a dim twilight sky. The howling wind carries ethereal
  whispers, blurring the line between reality and fantasy. The ground is a perilous
  sheet of ice, and mysterious shapes emerge in the distance, shrouded by the storm.
  The cold seeps into your very bones, a constant reminder of the isolation and latent
  threats in this frozen wasteland.
