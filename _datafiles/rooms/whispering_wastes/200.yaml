title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A relentless snowstorm cloaks the Whispering Wastes in a blanket of white.
  The sky, tinged with twilight, adds a mystic quality to the frozen expanse. The
  wind seems to whisper tales of yore, and the ice-slick ground holds treacherous
  secrets. In the distance, the remnants of old fortresses and towers loom, their
  forms ghostly and obscure in the snow.
