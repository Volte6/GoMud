title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the grip of an eternal blizzard, the Whispering Wastes stretch out
  like a frozen ocean. The sky, a perpetual twilight, sheds a faint, otherworldly
  light. The wind carries the distant screeches of winged creatures, their dark forms
  occasionally silhouetted against the grey sky. The snow-covered ground is uneven,
  hiding dangers beneath its pristine surface. The ruins of old watchtowers emerge
  from the snow, their once-mighty forms now bowed by time and weather.
