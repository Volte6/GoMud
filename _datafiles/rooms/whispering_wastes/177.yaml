title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The world is lost in a sea of white as the blizzard rages in the Whispering
  Wastes. The sky, a gloomy twilight, casts an otherworldly light over the icy expanse.
  The wind howls, carrying with it faint, ghostly echoes, and visibility is limited
  to just a few feet. Shadowy outlines of strange edifices loom in the distance, their
  forms twisted by the swirling snow. The cold penetrates deep, echoing the solitude
  and perils of this desolate, icy realm.
