title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The relentless blizzard of the Whispering Wastes creates a world of white
  isolation. The twilight sky casts a ghostly light, and the wind sings with spectral
  whispers. The ice-covered ground is treacherous underfoot, and in the distance,
  strange structures appear as mere shadows, distorted by the storm.
