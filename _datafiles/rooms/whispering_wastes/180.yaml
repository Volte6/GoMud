title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are shrouded in a relentless blizzard, turning
  the landscape into a canvas of white. The sky, locked in twilight, casts a ghostly
  glow, while the wind's howl is laced with faint, spectral whispers. Each step on
  the icy ground is fraught with uncertainty, and distant, strange structures emerge,
  twisted by the swirling snow.
