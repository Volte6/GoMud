title: Frozen Wasteland
description: As you traverse the relentless blizzard of the Whispering Wastes, the
  landscape begins to subtly change. The sky remains a dusky twilight, but the wind's
  howl softens, carrying a hint of something different, something hidden. The snow
  underfoot becomes uneven, hinting at rocky terrain beneath. In the distance, a jagged
  line of frost-coated rocks emerges, forming a natural barrier. Among these rocks,
  the faint outline of an opening becomes visible, half-concealed by snowdrifts.
