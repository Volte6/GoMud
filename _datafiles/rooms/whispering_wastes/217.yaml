title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Standing at the entrance of a cave in the heart of the Whispering Wastes,
  the contrast between the relentless blizzard outside and the stillness within is
  stark. The cave's mouth, a jagged maw in the rugged stone, is framed by icicles
  that glisten like crystal teeth under the twilight sky. The wind's howl diminishes
  here, its ghostly whispers unable to penetrate the cave's threshold. Peering into
  the darkness, you sense a profound depth, the air emanating a cold that seems older
  and deeper than the blizzard's chill. Snowflakes dance at the edge of the cave,
  reluctant to enter, as if respecting an ancient boundary.
