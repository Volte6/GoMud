title: Spiders web thicket
description: The air is heavy with a musty, earthy scent, and the soft rustling of
  leaves and webs creates an unsettling symphony. Massive spiderwebs, some spanning
  entire clearings, glisten like silver threads in the dim light. The thicket is alive
  with the unsettling skittering of giant spiders, their eight legs moving with unnerving
  grace.
