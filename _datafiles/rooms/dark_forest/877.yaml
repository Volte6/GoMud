title: Dark Chasm
description: At the northernmost reachable part of the chasm, the light barely penetrates,
  casting long, eerie shadows on the rough, uneven walls. A waterfall cascades from
  above, its waters crashing into the chasm floor and feeding the river that winds
  through the center. The air is thick and damp, filled with the scent of earth and
  decay, mingled with the fresh, cool mist from the waterfall. The ground beneath
  your feet is a treacherous mix of loose stones and ancient roots that snake across
  the path, threatening to trip the unwary.
