title: Spider queens nest
description: The Spider Queen's Nest is a place of profound darkness and peril. The
  air is thick with the pungent scent of decay, and the oppressive stillness is broken
  only by the eerie hum of the spider's chittering and the occasional drip of venom
  from the ceiling. Around the chamber, countless victims ensnared in the spider's
  silk cocoons hang in macabre suspension, their struggles long since silenced. The
  ground is treacherous, a web-covered graveyard where the bones and remnants of the
  Queen's prey lie hidden.
