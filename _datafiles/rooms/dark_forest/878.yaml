title: Inside of the waterfall
description: Behind the cascading waterfall lies a hidden cave, its entrance shrouded
  in mist and the constant roar of falling water. Inside, the cave is cool and damp,
  the walls slick with moisture and glistening in the dim light that filters through
  the water. The floor is uneven, covered in smooth, wet stones and patches of soft,
  green moss. Strange, bioluminescent fungi cling to the walls and ceiling, casting
  an ethereal, bluish glow that dances with the reflections from the water outside.
  The air is filled with the sound of water dripping from stalactites, creating a
  rhythmic, almost musical pattern that echoes softly through the cavern. The scent
  of fresh, clean water mingles with the earthy aroma of the cave, creating an atmosphere
  that is both invigorating and mysterious.
