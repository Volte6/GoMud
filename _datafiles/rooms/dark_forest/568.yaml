title: Forest bridge
description: The cut in the bridge is clean, as if sliced by a giant blade, leaving
  a jagged scar that speaks of sudden, deliberate destruction rather than gradual
  decay. The remaining section clings to the forested bank, overgrown with moss and
  ivy, the wood rotting and the stones crumbled, as if surrendering to the inevitable
  embrace of the forest. The far side, now unreachable, disappears into the dense
  tangle of trees and undergrowth, hinting at forgotten paths and lost journeys.
