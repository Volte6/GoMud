title: Forest Road
description: As you venture further along the old road, it leads you into the heart
  of the foreboding Dark Forest. The transition from the tranquil Frost Lake to this
  shadowy realm is abrupt and palpable. The once-clear path is now obscured by gnarled,
  twisted branches that reach out like skeletal fingers from ancient trees, their
  bark as black as night.
