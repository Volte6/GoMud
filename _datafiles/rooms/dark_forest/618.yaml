title: Web strewn path
description: The distant sound of rustling leaves and the ominous sensation of being
  watched slowly intensify. With each step, the forest road narrows until it opens
  abruptly into a nightmarish landscape. Massive webs glisten like silver threads,
  spanning the trees and the path ahead, and the ominous skittering of giant arachnids
  echoes through the oppressive silence.
