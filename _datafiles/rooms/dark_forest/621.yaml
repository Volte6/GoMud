title: Web covered tree
description: As you cautiously approach the massive tree at the heart of the Spider's
  Web Thicket, the oppressive stillness of the forest is punctuated by the haunting
  melodies of the wind, which weaves through the intricate webs that enshroud the
  colossal trunk. The tree itself is a gnarled and ancient giant, its bark obscured
  by layers upon layers of glistening silk cocoons.
