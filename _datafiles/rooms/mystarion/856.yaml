title: Lavender Walk
description: At the south-most end of Lavender Walk, the pathway comes to an abrupt
  halt at an ancient, ivy-covered stone wall. The fragrant lavender plants grow dense
  and wild up to the base of the wall, their purple blooms creating a vibrant contrast
  against the weathered stones. Enchanted lanterns flicker gently, casting a soft,
  soothing light on the surrounding area.
