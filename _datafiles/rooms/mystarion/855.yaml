description: The street is lined with quaint, ivy-covered cottages and stalls, each
  overflowing with bundles of fresh herbs, dried flowers, and potions in glass vials.
  Enchanted lanterns emit a soft, purple glow, casting a calming light over the cobblestone
  path. Herbalists and healers, clad in robes of earthy hues, offer remedies for ailments
  and advice on natural magic. The gentle hum of bees and the rustle of leaves in
  the breeze create a tranquil ambiance, making Lavender Walk a haven of peace and
  wellness in the bustling city of Mystarion.
