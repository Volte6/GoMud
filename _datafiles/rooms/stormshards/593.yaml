title: Mountain path
description: As the path winds upward, the surroundings become more barren; dwindling
  trees give way to craggy rocks and steep slopes. The terrain underfoot shifts to
  loose shale mingled with solid stone, and a large boulder rests subtly beside the
  trail, almost blending into the rugged backdrop. The sharp incline pushes even experienced
  travelers to their limits.
