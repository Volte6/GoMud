  description: 'Clad in robes or garments adorned with subtle enchanted patterns, they move with a grace that hints at their familiarity with the arcane. Their eyes often sparkle with the knowledge of spells and the wisdom of the ages, reflecting a deep connection to the mystical forces that permeate their world. Whether they are scholars, artisans, merchants, or healers, each citizen carries a small token of their magical craft-an amulet, a vial of potion, or a wand-symbolizing their personal expertise.'
