  name: dangerous ruffian
  description: 'The ruffian looms in the dimly lit alleyway of the slums, a menacing figure carved out of the shadows. His rough, weather-beaten face is partly obscured by a tattered hood, but his eyes gleam with a predatory sharpness, scanning the surroundings with a mix of suspicion and brazen confidence. Broad-shouldered and solidly built, his presence is intimidating, the result of a life hardened by the unforgiving streets of the slums. His clothes are a patchwork of leather and cloth, well-worn and stained, telling a silent tale of numerous brawls and escapades.'
