  description: 'The Timber Wolf is a hulking predator that prowls the shadowed depths of the Dark Forest, its mottled fur a blend of earthy browns and deep grays, perfectly suited to the dense, mist-laden woods it calls home. Unlike its northern cousins, the Timber Wolf is built for strength rather than speed, with a muscular frame and thick, knotted limbs that allow it to tear through underbrush and climb over fallen trees in pursuit of its prey. Its amber eyes gleam with a fierce intelligence, always scanning for movement among the forest shadows. The Timber Wolf is a pack animal, but its packs are smaller and more territorial, often staking claim to entire swathes of the forest. Its low, rumbling growl can be heard long before it strikes, a warning to those who dare venture into its realm.'
