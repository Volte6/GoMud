  description: 'Standing at just knee height, this creature possesses a lithe and agile form, covered in mossy-green skin that seamlessly blends with the surrounding foliage. Its large, almond-shaped eyes sparkle with an impish curiosity, and a crown of leaves and twigs adorns its head. The Forest Imp''s pointed ears twitch as it gazes back at you, revealing a sly intelligence that belies its whimsical appearance. Its fingers end in tiny, nimble claws, perfect for climbing and playing pranks.'
