description: The Initiate's Robe is a stark, utilitarian garment, symbolizing the acolyte's commitment to their somber duties. It is made of durable, dark fabric that hangs heavy on the wearer, designed to withstand the dampness and decay of the catacombs. The robe is unadorned save for a few simple, geometric patterns stitched along the hem and cuffs, signifying the wearer's rank within the order. The hood is practical in shape, meant to shield the eyes from the glare of torches and to preserve the wearer's anonymity. The cut is loose, allowing for ease of movement during rituals and ceremonies. Its simplicity is its statement, reflecting the solemn vows of its wearer to eschew worldly vanity and embrace the shadowed path they tread.
