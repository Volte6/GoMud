title: City gate
description: Crafted from massive slabs of stone that gleam with an inner light, the
  gate towers above, etched with intricate runes and symbols that shimmer with an
  ethereal energy. The heavy doors, made of a dark, ageless wood banded with iron,
  are thrown open, inviting yet imposing, as if challenging the worthiness of those
  who seek entry.
