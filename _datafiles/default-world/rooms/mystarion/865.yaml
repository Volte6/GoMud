title: Arena Registration Booth
description: The Arena Registration Booth stands proudly near the entrance of the
  Grand Arcane Arena, a quaint yet bustling hub of activity. Constructed from sturdy
  oak and draped with vibrant banners bearing the arena's sigil, the booth exudes
  an air of both tradition and excitement. The front of the booth is lined with enchanted
  lanterns that emit a welcoming glow, even in the brightest daylight. Inside, an
  attendant sits behind a polished wooden counter, surrounded by stacks of parchment
  scrolls, quills, and registration forms.
