title: The battlements
description: As you shift your gaze eastward, the imposing Stormshards give way to
  a panorama of tranquility. Below you stretches an expanse of fertile farmland, a
  tapestry of emerald fields and winding streams that paint the plateau with vibrant
  hues. The air is filled with the sweet scent of wildflowers and the soothing murmur
  of the breeze rustling through the tall grasses. As you stand upon the battlements,
  you feel a profound appreciation for the harmony that exists between humanity and
  nature.
