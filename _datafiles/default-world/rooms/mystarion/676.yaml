title: The battlements
description: Turning your gaze from the western panorama and towards the north, your
  eyes are met with a sight that takes your breath away. The Stormshards, a majestic
  mountain range that pierces the heavens, stretches out before you in all its splendor.
  As you survey the range, you notice that the Stormshards are not static, but rather
  constantly shifting and changing. Clouds swirl around the peaks, casting shadows
  that dance and writhe across the landscape. Lightning flashes, illuminating the
  mountains with an otherworldly glow.
