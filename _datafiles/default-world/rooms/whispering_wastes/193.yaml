title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the grip of an eternal blizzard, the Whispering Wastes are a landscape
  of endless white. The sky, a dim twilight, illuminates the snow-covered ground.
  The wind carries with it faint, spectral whispers, and the ground is perilous with
  ice. Distant structures emerge from the storm, their forms twisted and indistinct.
