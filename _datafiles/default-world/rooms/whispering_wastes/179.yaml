title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are engulfed in a relentless snowstorm, the sky
  a dim twilight. The wind carries ghostly whispers, as if the air itself holds ancient
  secrets. Visibility is reduced to a mere few feet, and each step is a risk on the
  ice-covered ground. In the distance, the shadows of bizarre structures and frozen
  spires loom, their forms blurred by the swirling snow.
