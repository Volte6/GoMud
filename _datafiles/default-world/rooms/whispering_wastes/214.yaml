title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are cloaked in a perpetual snowstorm, the landscape
  a monochrome world of snow and ice. The sky, locked in a state of twilight, gives
  the snow a ghostly luminescence. The wind carries the distant howling of phantom
  wolves, their calls adding to the land's haunted ambiance. The ground beneath is
  a hazardous mix of snow and hidden ice sheets.
