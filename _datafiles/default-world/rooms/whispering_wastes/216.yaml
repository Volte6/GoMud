title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Nearing the rocky expanse in the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard's intensity
  wanes slightly, allowing glimpses of the surroundings. The twilight sky casts a
  muted glow over the snow-laden landscape, now broken by rugged outcrops of stone.
  The wind, while still biting, carries an echo of deep, hollow spaces beyond. Approaching
  the rocky barrier, you notice the entrance to a cave getting nearer.
