title: Frozen Wasteland
description: The Whispering Wastes are a realm of eternal winter, where the sky remains
  a perpetual twilight. The blizzard muffles the world in white, and the wind whispers
  tales of yore. The ground is a treacherous sheet of ice, and strange, shadowy structures
  appear like mirages in the distance. The cold is bone-deep, a reminder of the solitude
  and dangers that lurk in this forsaken landscape.
