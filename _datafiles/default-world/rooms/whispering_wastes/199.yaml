title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard transforms the world into a white
  wilderness. The sky, a canvas of twilight blues and greys, casts a spectral glow.
  The wind's eerie song is laced with the murmurs of ancient secrets, and the ice-covered
  ground is a labyrinth of hidden dangers. Enigmatic shapes of long-lost monuments
  emerge in the distance, shrouded by the storm's embrace.
