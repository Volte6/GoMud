title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A realm of eternal winter, the Whispering Wastes are dominated by a ceaseless
  blizzard. The twilight sky casts long, eerie shadows over the landscape. The faint
  chattering of ice sprites can be heard in the wind, their playful yet mischievous
  presence a stark contrast to the desolation. The ground, a deceptive blanket of
  snow, conceals the treacherous ice beneath. In the distance, the ruins of a frozen
  citadel emerge from the snow, their spires reaching toward the sky like desperate
  hands.
