title: Frozen Wasteland
description: Here in the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard is unyielding, blanketing
  the world in a frosty haze. The sky, tinged with twilight, casts an eerie pallor
  over everything. The wind carries faint, spectral murmurs, and visibility is limited
  to just a few precarious steps. Enigmatic structures loom in the distance, their
  true nature obscured by the storm. The cold is pervasive, echoing the desolation
  and peril that pervades this lonely, treacherous terrain.
