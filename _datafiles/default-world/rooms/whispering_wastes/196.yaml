title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the heart of the Whispering Wastes, the snowstorm reigns supreme,
  turning day into an endless twilight. The wind's haunting howl carries echoes of
  ancient legends, and the ground beneath is a treacherous canvas of ice and snow.
  Shadowy forms of strange, frost-encrusted monoliths loom in the distance, their
  outlines barely discernible in the tempest.
