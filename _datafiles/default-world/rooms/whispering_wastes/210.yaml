title: Frozen Wasteland
description: A sea of white engulfs the Whispering Wastes, the blizzard obscuring
  all in its path. The sky, a dusky twilight, watches over the icy landscape. The
  faint growls of hidden creatures reverberate through the wind, their presence adding
  to the land's mystique. The ground beneath is a deceptive mix of snow and ice.
