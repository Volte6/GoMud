title: Frozen Wasteland
description: In the Whispering Wastes, the world is blanketed by a never-ending blizzard.
  The sky, a deep twilight hue, adds to the surreal atmosphere. The wind carries faint,
  haunting whispers, and the ground underfoot is a perilous sheet of ice. Enigmatic
  structures loom in the snow, their true nature hidden by the storm.
