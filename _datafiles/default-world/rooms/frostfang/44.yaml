title: Frostfang Castle East Wing
description: The East Wing of Frostfang Castle is characterized by its dimly lit corridors
  and chambers. The walls, made of cold, dark stone, are intermittently adorned with
  faded portraits of long-forgotten figures. Sparse, narrow windows allow only minimal
  light, casting deep shadows that play tricks on the eyes. The few sconces and lanterns
  provide little more than faint, flickering glows, making navigation a cautious endeavor
  and giving the entire wing an air of quiet solemnity.
