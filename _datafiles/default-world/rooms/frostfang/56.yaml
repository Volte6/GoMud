title: The Eastwind Promenade
description: Eastwind Promenade is the bustling artery that stretches directly to
  the East Frostfang Gate. Lined with cobblestones worn smooth by countless footsteps
  and cart wheels, the road is flanked by a myriad of alleyways and side streets,
  each leading to vibrant market squares and clusters of shops. From blacksmiths forging
  tools to apothecaries mixing potions, the Promenade is a sensory overload of sights,
  sounds, and scents. As travelers make their way to and from the gate, merchants
  hawk their wares, creating a lively tapestry of commerce and community that embodies
  the spirit of Frostfang.
