title: Residential Hedge
description: The hedge itself is thick and lush, its branches woven together so tightly
  that they form a barrier against the outside world. Small birds flit through the
  leaves, their chirps and songs adding a serene soundtrack to this hidden alcove.
  The hedge's interior is surprisingly spacious, allowing for quiet movement and exploration.
