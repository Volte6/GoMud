title: The Residential District
description: The streets, paved with cobblestone smoothed by countless footsteps,
  wind through the district like frozen rivers. Lanterns hang from wrought-iron posts,
  casting a soft, golden glow that dances across the snow-covered ground and illuminates
  the faces of those who walk these paths. Residents, wrapped in furs and thick cloaks,
  move about with purpose, their breath forming fleeting clouds in the cold air.
