title: Frostfang Castle North Hallway
description: The North Hallway serves as the vital artery connecting the East and
  West Wings of Frostfang Castle. Broad and imposing, its stone floor is lined with
  intricately designed mosaics that trace the castle's architectural lineage. Flanked
  by towering columns, the hallway is illuminated by sconces bearing blue flames,
  casting a soft, ethereal glow. Along its length, grand tapestries hang, depicting
  significant events in Frostfang's history, their colors still vibrant despite the
  passage of time. Every few steps, arched windows punctuate the walls, offering fleeting
  views of the castle's outer grounds. The ambient sound of whispered conversations
  from adjoining rooms and the occasional echo of footsteps serve as a reminder of
  the hallway's significance in bridging the castle's two distinct wings.
