description: The cold wind of Frostfang whistles through the narrow, snow-dusted streets
  of Beggars Lane. The cobblestones underfoot are slick with ice, making each step
  a cautious endeavor. The buildings here are old, their wooden facades weathered
  and gray, bearing the scars of many harsh winters. The windows, few and far between,
  are mostly boarded up, but from some, faint glimmers of candlelight seep out, casting
  eerie shadows on the snow.
