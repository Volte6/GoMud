title: Sanctuary Doors
description: The Sanctuary of the Benevolent Heart stands as a solemn monument amidst
  the bleakness of Beggars Lane. Its tall, stone spires, darkened by years of exposure
  to Frostfang's harsh climate, rise defiantly against the gray sky, while intricate
  carvings of benevolent deities and scenes of charity adorn its facade. The temple's
  heavy wooden doors, always slightly ajar, invite all into its warm embrace, where
  golden light from countless candles illuminates the hallowed interior, and the ever-present
  scent of burning incense serves as a comforting reminder of hope and sanctuary in
  a world often devoid of both.
