title: Frostfang Castle
description: Inside Frostfang Castle, the grand entrance hall is a testament to power
  and legacy. Tall, narrow windows allow only slivers of light to pierce the dimness,
  casting long shadows on the cold marble floors. The glow from austere chandeliers
  barely illuminates the walls, which are lined with dark tapestries depicting fierce
  battles and moments of dominance in Frostfang's history. The high, vaulted ceiling
  looms overhead, with frescoes that hint at stormy skies and mythical beasts. Statues
  of past rulers, stern and unyielding, stand sentinel on either side, their imposing
  perception demanding respect. In a distant corner, the somber tones of a live ensemble
  resonate, their haunting melody echoing through the hall.
