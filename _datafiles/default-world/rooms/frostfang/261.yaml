title: The Residential District
description: "The district's pathways, lined with cobblestones polished by endless
  passersby, snake through the area, mirroring the course of petrified streams. A
  minor yet noticeable split in the path leading northward arrests the attention of
  those who are alert. Around this junction, the golden radiance from lanterns perched
  on iron stands casts an inviting aura, highlighting this split, and bringing into
  relief the snow-draped ground and the determined faces of the locals. These residents,
  bundled in layers of fur and heavy garments, breathe out transient wisps of mist
  in the biting air, their footfalls subtly indicating an intriguing, seldom-seen
  house concealed close to the districtb\0\x19s northern boundary."
