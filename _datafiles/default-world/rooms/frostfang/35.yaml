title: The West Gate
description: The West Gate of Frostfang stands as a formidable sentinel at the terminus
  of the West Road. Crafted from massive blocks of gray stone, it's adorned with intricate
  frost patterns and ancient runes. Two towering statues of guardian beasts flank
  the gate, their stone eyes seeming to watch over all who pass. Beyond the gate,
  the vast expanse of the frozen tundra stretches out, its icy plains shimmering under
  the pale light, offering both a breathtaking view and a stark reminder of the harsh
  wilderness that lies just beyond Frostfang's protective walls.

  runes: The runes on the gate aren't just decorative; they appear to be part of an
    old language, possibly used for protective spells or rituals. The runes are only
    partially readable, and two of the words are scratched out. All you can make out
    is [ <ansi fg="109">Z-p---l lumara -ort--s</ansi> ].
  second: :vorthos
  statues: The statues of the guardian beasts stand as imposing monoliths on either
    side of the West Gate. Carved from a deep-gray, almost black stone, they depict
    creatures that seem to be a blend of myth and reality. The one on the left is
    known as zyphrial, and on the right is vorthos.
  vorthos: The statue on the right, known as vorthos, is serpentine, its long, coiled
    body reminiscent of a dragon. It has the scales of a reptile, but its face is
    almost humanoid, with deep-set eyes and a wise, contemplative expression. Twin
    horns spiral upwards from its forehead, and its clawed feet grip the base as if
    it's ready to pounce.
  zyphrial: The statue on the left, named zyphrial, has the body of a lion, muscular
    and poised, but its head is that of a majestic eagle with sharp, piercing eyes
    and a beak that looks ready to snap. Its wings, though folded, span wide, hinting
    at the power they hold when unfurled.

- The gate creaks in the wind.
- The eyes of the two statues seem to glow briefly... or maybe it was just your imagination.
