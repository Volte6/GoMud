# Modules

Extract any modules into this folder.

* Modules should be named uniquely, in a manner that identifies their purpose.

* Module folders should container a `datafiles` folder that contains any datafiles needed.
  * Files within `datafiles` will be treated as though located within the actual `_datafiles`
  * These files are read-only.
