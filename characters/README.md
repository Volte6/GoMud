# Stat Points

Players have statistics that naturally improve with experience levels based on their race.

These stat points can be further augmented by `Buffs` and by worn `Equipment` that provides `stat mods`.

Players also receive a stat point that they can manually assign as they please with each level.

## Stat Point Definitions/Philosophy

* Strength - Physical mass and power. Affects feats of strength and damage in combat (crit damage)
* Speed - Affects hitting and being hit, ability to perform many actions, etc
* Smarts - Raw intelligence. Memorization, effectiveness of spells, etc.
* Vitality -  Capability to take damage and keep functioning. affects HP
* Mysticism - Magical capabiity - affects MP. Affects spell casting success and resistance to other spells.
* Perception - Ability to see hidden things (i.e. hidden exits), understand complexities (i.e. lock picking), remain unseen (i.e. hiding), etc.

Stats that reach 105 get recalculated with anything over 100 applied as `SQRT(overage)*2`

So a stat of `150` would actually be calculated as `114`
